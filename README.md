# PARS-E-commerce
This repository contains the work of Lars Briels regarding his Master Thesis. In this thesis I have created a Process-Aware Recommendation System that predicts if an online customer on an e-commerce platform is likely to engage with the offline showrooms. If so, I intervene in the online customer journey by showing a pop-up.

## Code
In the code folder you can find the code for training, finetuning, and selecting the recommendation algorithm and the code for training the selected LSTM with the set hyperparameters and the preprocessing steps. You can also find the code for creating the stream data tag, creating the pop-up, creating the endpoint with aggregation function and prediction, and testing the endpoint by creating a bot that sends requests.

## Data
In the data folder the data for generating the process models in Disco and creating the LSTM can be found.
