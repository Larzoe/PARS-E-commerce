# PARS-E-commerce
This repository contains the work of Lars Briels regarding his Master Thesis. In this thesis I have created a Process-Aware Recommendation System that predicts if an online customer on an e-commerce platform is likely to engage with the offline showrooms. If so, I intervene in the online customer journey by showing a pop-upction and prediction, and testing the endpoint by creating a bot that sends requests.
